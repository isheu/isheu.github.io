      <p>I'd like to share some of my work immerses me in data, and it's wonderful to uncover stories and to tease out structure from data. <br>
      I'm excited to learn and busy myself learning techniques available to achieve this. <br>
      I'm particularly keen on exploring visualization as a narrative tool, and as a tool for experts to diagnose and evaluate their work. Most of my published projects on this site relate to this. <br>
